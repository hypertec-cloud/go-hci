A cloud.ca client for the Go programming language

## How to use

Import

```go
import "github.com/hypertec-cloud/go-hci"

/* import the services you need */
import "github.com/hypertec-cloud/go-hci/services/chi"
```

Create a new HciClient.

```go
hciClient := hci.NewHciClient("[your-api-key]")
```

Retrieve the list of environments

```go
environments, _ := hciClient.Environments.List()
```

Get the ServiceResources object for a specific environment and service. Here, we assume that it is a hci service.

```go
resources, _ := hciClient.GetResources("[service-code]", "[environment-name]")
hciResources := resources.(hci.Resources)
```

Now with the hci ServiceResources object, we can execute operations on hci resources in the specified environment.

Retrieve the list of instances in the environment.

```go
instances, _ := hciResources.Instances.List()
```

Get a specific volume in the environment.

```go
volume, _ := hciResources.Volumes.Get("[some-volume-id]")
```

Create a new instance in the environment.

```go
createdInstance, _ := hciResources.Instances.Create(hci.Instance{
    Name: "[new-instance-name]",
    TemplateId: "[some-template-id]",
    ComputeOfferingId:"[some-compute-offering-id]",
    NetworkId:"[some-network-id]",
})
```

## Handling Errors

When trying to get a volume with a bogus id, an error will be returned.

```go
// Get a volume with a bogus id
_, err := hciResources.Volumes.Get("[some-volume-id]")
```

Two types of error can occur: an unexpected error (ex: unable to connect to server) or an API error (ex: service resource not found)
If an error has occured, then we first try to cast the error into a HciErrorResponse. This object contains the HTTP status code returned by the server, an error code and a list of HciError objects. If it's not a HciErrorResponse, then the error was not returned by the API.

```go
if err != nil {
    if errorResponse, ok := err.(api.HciErrorResponse); ok {
        if errorResponse.StatusCode == api.NOT_FOUND {
            fmt.Println("Volume was not found")
        } else {
            // Can get more details from the HciErrors
            fmt.Println(errorResponse.Errors)
        }
    } else {
        // handle unexpected error
        panic("Unexpected error")
    }
}
```
